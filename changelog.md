# Changes to TCP-INT in version 0.1.0-alpha

## New features

* eBPF inserts TCP-INT option header into TCP packets being sent
* eBPF parses TCP-INT option header from received packets, and sends metrics to user-space for consumption
* Only programs (PIDs) in the tcp-int cgroup will have their TCP flows tagged by TCP-INT
* tcp_int user-space tool loads and configures eBPF
* User-space tcp_int tool prints trace of INT as it arrives
* The exporter receives INT events from the eBPF module and sends them as gRPC messages to a collector server
* Script and instructions for trying TCP-INT on a single server with network namespaces
* Script to plot timeseries of INT from trace generated by tcp_int tool

## Limitations

* Fine-grained flow filtering: currently, all TCP flows belonging to a PID in the tcp-int cgroup will be tagged. In addition, it would be useful to tag flows based on some filters (e.g., destination port, destination address, socket options).
* Testing: the tests in this release only exercise the basic functionality.
