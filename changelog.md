# Changes to TCP-INT in version 0.4.0-alpha

## New features

 * Link speed
 * Available bandwidth

## Optimizations

 * New Version option to display currently running tcp-int version
 * Removed link utilzation feature

# Changes to TCP-INT in version 0.3.0-alpha

## New features

* Dynamic tagging policy: the eBPF specifies the tagging frequency to get timely updates without hurting performance
* New header option fields: TagFreqKey and LinkSpeed
* Compact encoding of Ecr fields: HopLat and IDEcr
* Performance evaluation scripts that configure the system and run workloads with various parameters
* Histograms of sent and received skb length
* Makefile configures the number of CPUs at compile time (instead of manually editing the header file)

## Optimizations

* Removed compiler warnings
* Avoid multiple eBPF map lookups by caching result

## Maintenance

* Renamed "SwitchID" to "HopID"
* Renamed "iratio" to "tagging frequency"

## Limitations

* The new 4-bit IDEcr encoding represents at most 15 hops on the path


# Changes to TCP-INT in version 0.2.0-alpha

## New features

* eBPF inserts TCP-INT option header into TCP packets being sent
* eBPF parses TCP-INT option header from received packets, and sends metrics to user-space for consumption
* Only programs (PIDs) in the tcp-int cgroup will have their TCP flows tagged by TCP-INT
* tcp_int user-space tool loads and configures eBPF
* User-space tcp_int tool prints trace of INT as it arrives
* The exporter receives INT events from the eBPF module and sends them as gRPC messages to a collector server
* Script and instructions for trying TCP-INT on a single server with network namespaces
* Script to plot timeseries of INT from trace generated by tcp_int tool

## Limitations

* Fine-grained flow filtering: currently, all TCP flows belonging to a PID in the tcp-int cgroup will be tagged. In addition, it would be useful to tag flows based on some filters (e.g., destination port, destination address, socket options).
* Testing: the tests in this release only exercise the basic functionality.
